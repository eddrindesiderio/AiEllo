# How to Command Your AI in Discord

## ü§ñ Two Ways to Use Your AI Bot

### Method 1: Slash Commands Bot (Recommended - Easier)

**Start the slash commands bot:**
```bash
python deployment/discord_bot_slash.py
```

**Available Commands:**

1. **`/hello`** - Simple greeting
   ```
   /hello
   ```
   *AI will respond with a natural greeting*

2. **`/chat message: [your question]`** - General chat
   ```
   /chat message: What is 2+2?
   /chat message: Hello, how are you?
   /chat message: Can you help me with coding?
   ```

3. **`/about`** - Get information about Eddrin
   ```
   /about
   ```
   *AI will share your personal information and skills*

### Method 2: Mention-Based Bot (Traditional)

**Start the mention bot:**
```bash
python deployment/discord_bot.py
```

**How to use:**
- **Mention the bot** by typing `@YourBotName` followed by your message

**Examples:**
```
@YourBotName Hello
@YourBotName What is 2+2?
@YourBotName Who is Eddrin?
@YourBotName What are my skills?
@YourBotName Can you help me with web development?
```

HUGGINGFACE=your_actual_huggingface_token_here
```

### Step 3: Start Your Bot
Choose one:

Bot: 5 + 3 = 8

```

### Mention-Based Examples:

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Bot doesn't respond:**
- Make sure the bot is running (check your terminal)
- Check if bot has permissions in the channel
- For slash commands: Wait a few minutes for Discord to sync commands

**"API key not found" error:**
- Make sure you added your Hugging Face API key to .env file
- Restart the bot after updating .env

**Slash commands not showing:**
- Wait 5-10 minutes for Discord to sync
- Try restarting the bot
- Make sure bot has "Use Slash Commands" permission

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use slash commands** - They're easier and don't require special permissions
2. **Be specific** - Ask clear questions for better responses
3. **Test different scenarios** - Try math, general questions, and personal questions
4. **Keep the bot running** - The bot only works while the Python script is running

Your AI bot will now respond naturally to general questions and only share your personal information when specifically asked!
