# üîç BlackBox AI API Error Analysis

## ‚ùå What the Errors Mean

### **Error 1 & 2: Status 400 - ExceededBudget**
```
"ExceededBudget: User=brokenpeace8@gmail.com over budget. Spend=0.0, Budget=-1e-"
```

**Meaning:**
- ‚ùå Your BlackBox AI account (`brokenpeace8@gmail.com`) has exceeded its budget
- ‚ùå Budget is set to negative value (`Budget=-1e-`)
- ‚ùå Even though you've spent $0.0, the budget limit is preventing API calls

**Solution:** You need to add credits or upgrade your BlackBox AI account

### **Error 3: Status 404 - Not Found**
```
{"detail":"Not Found"}
```

**Meaning:**
- ‚ùå The endpoint `/api/chat` doesn't exist on BlackBox AI
- ‚ùå This is not a valid API endpoint for BlackBox AI

### **Error 4: Status 403 - Forbidden**
```
"Generated by BLACKBOX.AI, try unlimited chat https://www.blackbox.ai"
```

**Meaning:**
- ‚ùå This endpoint requires you to use the web interface instead of API
- ‚ùå BlackBox AI is directing you to use their website for unlimited chat
- ‚ùå API access might be restricted or require different authentication

## üéØ The Real Issue

**Your BlackBox AI API Key (`sk-BtiFdMb6OKw95pLEGknfhQ`) has these problems:**

1. **Budget Exceeded**: Account is over budget (even at $0 spend)
2. **Invalid Endpoints**: Most endpoints don't exist or are restricted
3. **Account Limitations**: Free tier might not include API access
