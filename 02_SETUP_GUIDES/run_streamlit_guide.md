# How to Run Your Streamlit Web App

## 🚨 Current Issue
You ran `python deployment/streamlit_app.py` which causes ScriptRunContext warnings.

## ✅ Correct Way to Run Streamlit

### Method 1: Run Streamlit App
```bash
streamlit run deployment/streamlit_app.py
```

### Method 2: Alternative Command
```bash
python -m streamlit run deployment/streamlit_app.py
```

## 🎯 What You'll See
When you run it correctly, you should see:
```
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

Local URL: http://localhost:8501
Network URL: http://192.168.x.x:8501
```

## 🌐 Access Your Web App
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: http://localhost:8501
3. You'll see your personal AI chat interface

## 🎮 Test Your Web App
Try these in the web interface:
- "Hello" - Should give natural greeting
- "1+1=?" - Should return "1 + 1 = 2"
- "What are my skills?" - Should return your personal info
- "essay basics" - Should give essay writing help

## 🔧 Both Apps Working
Now you have:
- **Discord Bot**: `/chat`, `/hello`, `/about` commands
- **Web App**: Browser-based chat interface

Both use the same intelligent fallback system!
