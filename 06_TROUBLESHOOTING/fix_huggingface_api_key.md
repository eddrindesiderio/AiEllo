# Fix Hugging Face API Key Issue

## 🚨 Current Problem
Your Hugging Face API key `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` is not working properly. This could be due to:

1. **Expired Token** - API keys can expire
2. **Invalid Permissions** - Token might not have the right permissions
3. **Rate Limits** - You might have exceeded usage limits
4. **Invalid Token** - The token might be corrupted or invalid

## 🔧 Solution: Get a New API Key

### Step 1: Go to Hugging Face
1. Visit: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
2. Log in to your Hugging Face account

### Step 2: Create a New Token
1. Click **"New token"**
2. Give it a name like "Discord Bot API Key"
3. Select **"Read"** permission (this is sufficient for inference)
4. Click **"Generate a token"**

### Step 3: Copy Your New Token
1. Copy the new token (it will start with `hf_`)
2. **Important**: Save it somewhere safe - you won't see it again!

### Step 4: Update Your .env File
Replace the old token in your `.env` file:

**Old:**
```
HUGGINGFACE=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
```

**New:**
```
HUGGINGFACE=hf_YOUR_NEW_TOKEN_HERE
```

### Step 5: Test Your New Token
Run this command to test:
```bash
python test_api_key_simple.py
```

You should see:
```
✅ API Key format looks correct
✅ Successfully created InferenceClient
✅ API call successful!
🎉 Your Hugging Face API key is working perfectly!
```

### Step 6: Restart Your Discord Bot
```bash
python deployment/discord_bot_slash.py
```

You should see:
```
🔍 Debug: HF API Key found: Yes
🔍 Debug: HF API Key starts with: hf_YOUR_NEW...
✅ Hugging Face client initialized successfully
```

## 🎯 Test Your Bot
Once working, test in Discord:
- `/chat message: essay basics` - Should give helpful essay advice
- `/chat message: 1+1=?` - Should return "1 + 1 = 2"
- `/chat message: What are my skills?` - Should return your personal info

## 🆓 Alternative: Use Without API Key
Your bot now works well even without the Hugging Face API! It provides:
- ✅ Accurate math answers
- ✅ Personal information about Eddrin
- ✅ Helpful responses for common questions
- ✅ Essay writing guidance
- ✅ General assistance

The fallback responses are quite comprehensive and useful!

## 💡 Troubleshooting
If you still have issues:
1. Make sure there are no extra spaces in the .env file
2. Restart your terminal/command prompt
3. Try generating a new token with different permissions
4. Check if your Hugging Face account is in good standing

```bash
# Test API key
python test_api_key_simple.py

# Check environment variables
python -c "from dotenv import load_dotenv; import os; load_dotenv(); print('Key found:', bool(os.getenv('HUGGINGFACE')))"
