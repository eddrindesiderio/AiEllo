```

## 📝 Update Your .env File

Open your `.env` file and make sure it contains:

```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=MTM5NTM5MDk0MjY1OTM0NjU1NA.G07Vdg.HPNZ5_GW3KTw3t22D4euTy_0eCpRRRwe35KSoU
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=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
```

## 🚀 Test Your Bot

After updating the .env file, test your Discord bot:

```bash
python deployment/discord_bot_slash.py
```

You should see:
```
🔍 Debug: HF API Key found: Yes
🔍 Debug: HF API Key starts with: hf_ampqVnM...
🔍 Debug: Using API key: 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
✅ Hugging Face client initialized successfully
✅ Logged in as YourBotName#1234
🤖 Bot is ready to chat!
✅ Synced 3 command(s)
```

## 🎯 Test Commands in Discord

Once your bot is running, test these commands in Discord:

### Math Questions (Should work now!)
- `/chat message: 1+1=?` → Should return "1 + 1 = 2" ✅
- `/chat message: 2+2` → Should return "2 + 2 = 4" ✅

### Personal Questions
- `/chat message: What are my skills?` → Should return your personal info ✅
- `/about` → Should return your complete background ✅

### General Questions
- `/hello` → Should give a friendly greeting ✅
- `/chat message: essay basics` → Should give essay writing help ✅

## 🌐 Also Test Your Web App

Run your Streamlit web app:
```bash
streamlit run deployment/streamlit_app.py
```

Then visit: http://localhost:8501

## ✅ Everything Should Work Now!

With both your Discord token and Hugging Face API key properly configured, your AI system should now:

1. **Provide accurate responses** - No more inappropriate personal info sharing
2. **Handle math correctly** - "1+1=?" returns "1 + 1 = 2"
3. **Work with full AI capabilities** - Your Hugging Face API key is now detected
4. **Function on both platforms** - Discord bot AND web interface

Your AI is now fully functional and accurate! 🎉
